solve(f, *symbols, **flags)

-poly
-transcendental
-piecewise combos of above
-sys of linear and poly eq (do we want?)

f = Expr/Poly (=0), Equality, Relational expr, Boolean

1. allow complex numbers or not // symbol('t', real=True)


1b. e.g. t=Symbol('t', positive=True, integer=True, commutative=True)
sqrt(t**2) // = t
otherwise, no sol.

2. allow limits or not (e.g. solve sin(x)/x=1)

Sum(f(n), (n, 0, m))

3. Switch to solveset - which provides domains
e.g. sin(x)=0 has infinitely many solutions otherwise
 _or_ just let us reduce the numb of sols?

//solveset can return infinitely many solutions. For example solving for sin(x)=0 returns {2nπ|n∈Z}∪{2nπ+π|n∈Z}, whereas solve only returns [0,π].

solveset(equation, variable=None, domain=S.Complexes)

Solving for complex solutions of inequalities, like x^2<0 is not yet supported.

If the function is trigonometric or hyperbolic, the function _solve_real_trig is called, which solves it by converting it to complex exponential form.

The underlying method _solve_as_poly solves the equation using polynomial techniques if it’s already a polynomial equation or, with a change of variables, can be made so.
